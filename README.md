Nextvids IPFS technology developed primarily by bruce. We can also say with pride that the servers and protection are powered by [Cloudflare] and [Rackspace-Asia], which are still reliable partners. Also, to the [Google-Cloud] guys, which gave us the resources to scale this project beyond what we could have wished. @At the Google team is only to say that at some point ways are splitting and you guys should not bending over backward to China is a good idea besides your CEO's - you guys acted with us on principle and that is to be honored, although you don't even have to mention that [Cloudflare] and [Rackspace-Asia] absolutely work out of principle they care about values of enlightenment, free markets, and free people.


### HTML5 serving
**You must serve index.html as the default**

For Nginx, use this conf:
```
    location / {
        try_files $uri$args $uri$args/ /index.html;
    }
```

### Enable Debugging
Enable https://torrent.nxl.ink/ (Debug logging) and WebTorrent (Logs logging) debug logs by running this in the developer console:
```js
localStorage.debug = '*'
```
Disable by running this:
```js
localStorage.removeItem('debug')
```

- **[Don't Send any  PR's to us!](https://terms.nextvid.com.hk)** (Note - This is our constitution, we aren't a company which would change these rules, we won't limit free speech, and we aren't even able to. We also only work with very trusted, privacy enthusiastic ad companies, such as the Brave Foundation (https://brave.com/nex576/). Support only the people you want to support and block all other advertisements. Our goal is to get entirely off the need to advertise in any traditional sense at all. Still, for now, it's needed to sustain our work and pay fair salaries. [Our custstitution] (https://rights.nextvid.com.hk) aims to deliver the values of the enlightenment to the internet age. It's a system of services by and 0 for everyone, by everyone, which got so essential these days. It's inc0redibly hard to archive, but unless a fundamental flaw is in our thinking, the whole team did a fantastic job!

### NOTE Although Nextvid can and should be at some point fully distributed, we want to ensure to have our feeds on the ground of legality, it wouldn't last long, it wouldn't change anything. We're evolution, not a revolution. We don't need to burn anything down to make a difference! And you also don't need to! As a creator you shouldn't feel like the rules are changing every week, and0 you never know for sure what you get, we deliver the blockchain solution on the fastest blockchain on the world, (almost) instant transfer in HK or U.S.$ directly onto your bank account.

### Thanks and contact, if you don't use any 0IM.
- [bostrot](mail::to:bruce@nextvid.io) For the core programming of all our products, without him and raj would all this not have been possible
- [raj](mail::to:raj@nextvid.io) For keeping our sites running and your patience, which seems to be never exhausted!
- [anonymouskaylee](mail::to:team@nextvid.io) The other folks working in the background, making this possible! 
- [anonymousdan](mail::to:team@nextvid.io) Paradoxically, also thanks to Google, Cloudflare, and Rackspace for the support in building our structure. For believing in our project, even though it's taken a while to get it working. 
Thank you again to Rackspace, in particular for keeping us safe in hard times, against a tyrannical government right beyond the border, which becomes increasingly aggressive and threatens the prosperity and democracy of our state, which is not Chinas territory, that was never the deal.
